## Received signal strength and local terrain profile data for radio network planning and optimization at GSM frequency bands {.tabset}

### **Introduction**

<br>
In the contemporary world, numerous advancements in technology are being discovered and utilized, in line with the goal of enhancing it further. Everything is constantly developing in such ways just like how instant messaging applications have taken over the mailman’s job.

<br>
During the 21st century, Smartphones and Smart TVs have shaped the world. Due to the large demand for these innovations, mobile networks have also been studied and improved in order to cope up with the development of smart devices. The Received Signal Strength (RSS) of the transmitted signals are investigated as well as the factors that affect the strength of radio waves in wireless channels. Terrain elevation, clutter height, altitude, and the distance from the mobile station are some of the variables that are significant in this research.

<br>
In radio network planning and optimization, the profile of the propagation environments and the local terrain are crucial in determining the performance of the radio waves. It varies depending on the terrain parameters and RSS of the location.
<br>

The correlation between the signal power and propagation environment provides a formulation of the radio propagation models which is essential to predict the strength of the radio waves.

### **Methodology**




### **Results and Discussion**
<h3> 900 MHz </h3>

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dt1 = read.csv("sec3_900.csv")
model <- lm(rss ~ elevation + altitude + distance, data = dt1)
summary(model)
```

$$ Signal\:Strength = -74.402204-1.347962\:terrain\:elevation+0.252856\:altitude-0.001454\:distance$$

<h3><b>T-test on each regression coefficient (α=0.05). </h3></b>
<p>**Hypotheses:** </p><br>
$\large H_0:B_0=0,\: H_1:B_0\neq0,\:B_0=intercept$<br>
$\large H_0:B_1=0,\: H_1:B_1\neq0,\:B_1=coefficient\:of\:terrain\:elevation$<br>
$\large H_0:B_2=0,\: H_1:B_2\neq0,\:B_2=coefficient\:of\:altitude$<br>
$\large H_0:B_3=0,\: H_1:B_3\neq0,\:B_3=coefficient\:of\:distance$<br><br>
<p>**Reject** $H_0:B=0$ **if: the P-value is less than 0.05.** </p>
<p>**Test statistic:** </p>
<p>Based from table 2.1</p>
$$\large P_0=7.74*10^-9$$
$$\large P_1=0.019$$
$$\large t_2=0.763$$
$$\large t_3=0.460$$
<p>Conclusion: The researchers only reject the null hypothesis for $B_1$. 
<p>*Practical Interpretation:* The t-tests indicate that only the altitude contribute to the model </p>
