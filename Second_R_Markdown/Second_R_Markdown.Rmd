# Monty Hall Problem 


# Lotto Problem

<p> One of the most popular major games of PCSO is the Ultra Lotto 6/58. At ₱20 per ticket, how much would a bettor spend to cover all of the possible combinations. Would the grand prize of ₱50 million cover all the expenses or it would simply incur a massive loss on the bettor? </p>
<center>
$$\LARGE {_{n}C_{k}=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} }$$
$$\LARGE {_{58}C_{6}=\frac{58!}{6!(58-6)!} }$$
$$\LARGE {=\frac{58!}{6!52!} }$$
$$\LARGE \hspace{25 mm}=40,475,358$$

$$\LARGE (40,475,358)(₱20)$$
$$\LARGE \hspace{25 mm}\fbox{=₱809,507,160}$$
